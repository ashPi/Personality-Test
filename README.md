# Personality-Test
That was me trying to turn a website I really liked (https://www.16personalities.com/) into a desktop app. It is also my first attempt to work with GUIs.

At the time I was working on this project the design of the website was different and my app's design corresponds to that. The images and icons that I have used are all coming from the original website.
I don't know how the actual grading algorithm that stands behind the actual test in the website works and I have just come up with my own grading which is most probably very far from the original one, therefore the results from the test in the app are probably not the same as the ones the user would receive form the website.

The app can be accessed from PersonalityTest/PersonalityTest/bin/Debug/PersonalityTest.exe 
NB:The app is in Bulgarian.
